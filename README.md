# React Web App CA2
For this assignment we are required to develop a web app using the React front-end JavaScript library.  The application uses OpenDotA API to provide the data I need and for the styling I used Bootstrap. The application allows the user to filter the heroes by roles, attack type and name.

1. Download the file
2. Open node.js command prompt
3. Change the directory: cd my-app
4. Run the app: npm start
